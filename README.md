# CIMA_Clothes
**My first Project**

CIMA_Clothes is a marketplace for clothes, any user can register in the Web and upload the product to be seen for other users

https://miquelortiz7e4.alwaysdata.net/api/v1/static/html/index.html --> This is the link of my web site.

##### How it works?
  **-index.html**
  
  First you will find an empty page. Open the menu on the top-left and push *Add product*
  
  **-LogIn.html**
  
  Automatically you'll be redirect to Log in page --> if you aren't a user yet, please register first!
  
  **-addProduct.html**
  
  Then once you are logged or registered, you can add Products by gender (Kid, Man, Woman)
  
  **-ProductDetail.html**
  
  Once the product is introduced, you can push into the product and see the detail information.
